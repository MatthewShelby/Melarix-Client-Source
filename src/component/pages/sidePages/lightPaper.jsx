                                                      So, here's the scoop. Traditional online learning can get a bit overwhelming and scattered. It's like trying to find your way in a maze, and reaching out to experts can be a bit hard. And when it comes to web3 development, finding the right instructions and courses is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Sure, the info is out there, but it's scattered, and that causes two big headaches for developers.
                                                </p><p>
                                                      First, some learning sources may be challenging to find, inaccessible to everyone, too costly, or bundled with a long irrelevant package.
                                                </p><p>
                                                      Second, most of the time, sources use different tech or versions than we do, making them a pain to fit into our projects. If you've ever tried building something awesome, you know the struggle. Each piece needs to play nicely with the others. Grabbing info from different sources leads to versions not matching up, and that's a recipe for disaster. Having clear instructions and sample functional source code is like gold.

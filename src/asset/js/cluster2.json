To delve into the intricacies of the EVM, it's essential to first understand the fundamental concept of a smart contract.</p><p><br>To gain a broad understanding of the EVM, we'll explore:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>What constitutes a Smart Contract.</li><li>How EVM Works.</li><li>How Results are Placed in the Blockchain.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Part 1 - What is a Smart Contract:</strong></span></span></h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p></h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">A smart contract is not merely a line of code; it's a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into its code. Think of it as a digital agreement that automatically enforces and executes itself when predefined conditions are met. These contracts, often crafted in languages like Solidity, have become the building blocks of decentralized applications (dApps) and the lifeblood of Ethereum's decentralized ecosystem.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">After a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain, it receives a distinctive set of characters known as the \"Smart Contract Address.\" This address is intricately linked to the contract, remaining immutable and will never change.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Key Characteristics of Smart Contracts:</strong></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Decentralized Execution:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">Smart contracts operate on decentralized blockchain networks, ensuring that execution is not controlled by a central authority. This decentralization enhances transparency and removes the reliance on a single governing entity.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Autonomy and Self-Execution:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">Once deployed, a smart contract operates autonomously, executing its predefined code without the need for external intervention. This self-executing nature streamlines processes and reduces the potential for disputes arising from ambiguous contract terms.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Immutable Code:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">The code of a smart contract is typically immutable once deployed on the blockchain. Immutability ensures that the terms of the contract remain unchanged and that the parties involved can trust the integrity of the agreement over time.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Cryptographic Security:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">Smart contracts leverage cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and data. Public and private key pairs authenticate parties and validate the integrity of the contract, adding an extra layer of security to the digital agreement.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Cost Efficiency and Trust:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">By eliminating intermediaries, smart contracts reduce costs associated with traditional contract execution. Additionally, the trust embedded in the code and the decentralized nature of execution contribute to a more efficient and secure contractual environment.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Part 2- How EVM Works:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">We'll look at how EVM plays a crucial role in making sure smart contracts run smoothly on the Ethereum blockchain.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Sandbox Execution Environment:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">The EVM provides a sandboxed execution environment, isolating each smart contract to prevent direct access to external resources. This security measure ensures that contracts operate independently, free from potential external manipulations.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Gas Mechanism:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">At the core of EVM's functionality is the gas mechanism. Users pay for computational resources using Ether, and gas serves as the unit measuring the computational work required. This mechanism not only prevents abuse but also adds a layer of economic incentive, making the system self-sustaining.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">In simpler terms, gas is like the fee users pay to network participants to get the smart contract functions running.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Opcode Operations:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">EVM executes bytecode, a low-level programming language. Each bytecode instruction corresponds to an opcode operation, defining tasks such as arithmetic, data storage, and flow control. This low-level approach allows for efficient and deterministic contract execution.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Deterministic Execution:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">EVM ensures deterministic execution, a crucial aspect of the consistency of the Ethereum network. Determinism means that the same inputs will always produce the same outputs, guaranteeing reliability and predictability in smart contract execution across all nodes.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>State Transition Model:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">Transactions processed by the EVM result in a state transition. The global state of the Ethereum blockchain is updated, reflecting changes in account balances, contract storage, and other relevant parameters. This state transition model is fundamental to understanding how smart contract outcomes are integrated into the broader blockchain.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">In essence, the Ethereum Virtual Machine operates as the powerhouse behind the execution of smart contracts, orchestrating a ballet of security measures, economic considerations, and deterministic principles to ensure the seamless and reliable functioning of decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">In straightforward terms, the EVM is like a virtual environment where software, known as a \"Smart Contract,\" gets executed and Users power it up by paying the gas.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Part 3 - How Results are Placed in the Blockchain:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">Now, let's demystify the process of how the outcomes of executed smart contracts find their permanent home on the blockchain.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>State Transition and Blockchain Integration:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">After a smart contract executes within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a significant step follows—the state transition. This process involves updating the global state of the Ethereum blockchain. Changes in account balances, contract storage, and other relevant data are recorded, reflecting the impact of the executed contract on the broader blockchain.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Immutable Records:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">The blockchain is renowned for its immutability, meaning once information is added, it cannot be altered or tampered with. The results of smart contract executions, being an integral part of this blockchain, inherit this trait. This ensures the integrity and permanence of the recorded outcomes, fostering trust and reliability in the decentralized ecosystem.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Transaction Confirmation:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">Once the state transition is completed, the details of the executed contract and its outcomes are confirmed through the consensus mechanism of the Ethereum network. This confirmation solidifies the legitimacy of the transaction, ensuring that all participants in the network agree on the updated state.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><strong>Decentralized Verification:</strong></span></span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height:107%;\">One of the strengths of blockchain lies in its decentralized nature.

The effective balance will be calculated based on the address history.</p><p>The balance of an address is the summation of all received funds (inputs) minus the summation of all sent funds (outputs).</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Bitcoin Transaction:</span></h3><p><br>A Bitcoin transaction is a piece of data determining an action (in this case, the action is a transfer of funds) reviewed and confirmed by participants (nodes) recorded on the blockchain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The recorded data consist of these:</p><p><strong>Inputs:</strong></p><p>The inputs to a transaction are the funds that have been transferred to the address before, haven’t been sent out yet, and are now being spent. (AKA UTXO, DOYR)</p><p>—</p><p><strong>Outputs:</strong></p><p>The outputs of a transaction determine where the funds are being sent. Each output specifies an amount of cryptocurrency and the recipient’s address.</p><p><i>Note: A transaction can have multiple Inputs and multiple outputs.</i></p><p>—</p><p><strong>Signature:</strong></p><p>The signature proves the sender’s ownership of the funds being spent.</p><p>—</p><p><strong>Fee:</strong></p><p>It’s the amount paid to miners for processing and including the transaction in a block.</p><p>—</p><p><strong>Transaction ID (TXID):</strong></p><p>It’s a unique identifier to reference the transaction on the blockchain.</p><p>—</p><p><strong>ScriptSig (Script Signature):</strong></p><p>The ScriptSig is part of a transaction that contains the required signatures and the script that unlocks a UTXO for spending.</p><p>—</p><p><strong>ScriptPubKey (Script Public Key):</strong></p><p>In the output, this is the script that defines the conditions that must be met to spend the output.</p><p>—</p><p>Basically, when we are transferring bitcoin, we are creating a new document (outputs) that shows we are transferring some of our funds to an address, and we back it up using our previously received documents (Inputs).&nbsp;</p><p>We sign the new document using our private key (corresponding to the public key hash on the inputs).&nbsp;</p><p>Afterward, Only the owner of the receiver address can sign another document (using their private key) to send the fund to someone else.</p><p><i>Note: a Bitcoin wallet is a software that facilitates this operation.</i></p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Address Types:</span></h3><p><br>The type of address allocated to the user is usually defined in the wallet core software. But sometimes, the wallet has an option to choose the type. Either way, we are going to have a deeper look into it.</p><p>There are four types of addresses that most wallets and platforms are using.</p><ul><li>Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH)</li><li>Pay 2 Script Hash (P2SH)</li><li>Pay to Witness Public Key Hash (P2WPKH)</li><li>Pay to Witness Script Hash (P2WSH)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthewShelby/Melarix/main/assets/Article/004-1/01.webp\"><figcaption>Legacy and SegWit comparison<br>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Legacy and SegWit comparison:</strong><br>“Legacy” refers to the traditional way of handling transactions in the Bitcoin network. It involves storing all transaction data directly inside the blockchain blocks. While this approach is well-established, it can lead to higher fees and slower processing times compared to the innovative solutions brought by SegWit.</p><p>SegWit (Segregated Witness) is a proposed upgrade (soft fork — DYOR) to the Bitcoin protocol that aims to reduce the amount of transaction data stored directly inside the block. The remaining data, known as the witness, is also stored on the nodes, ensuring security. This innovative approach maintains the security and integrity of the Bitcoin blockchain while significantly decreasing the transaction fee.</p><p><i>Note: SegWit transactions can result in fee savings of around 20% to 30% compared to legacy transactions.</i></p><p>—</p><p><strong>Key vs Script:</strong><br>Unlocking funds are different for different address types. In p2pkh and p2wpkh transactions, the transferred funds can be unlocked using the receiver’s private key. But in p2sh and p2wsh, some conditions must be met to unlock the fund. (Conditions like needing more than one signature or a time stamp to pass, etc.)</p><p>—</p><p>In P2SH transactions, the owner of the receiver address must provide a redeemScript* to unlock the funds.</p><p>Similarly, for P2WSH transactions, the owner must provide the witnessScript* to unlock the funds.</p><p>Multi-Signature is one of the functionalities enabled by P2SH and P2WSH address types.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthewShelby/Melarix/main/assets/Article/004-1/02.webp\"><figcaption>Public key Hash and Script Hash comparison</figcaption></figure><p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p><p><br><i>Note: P2PKH addresses start with ‘1’, P2SH addresses start with ‘3’, and SegWit addresses begin with ‘bc1’.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Note: There’s a more advanced BTC address type known as P2TR, designed to accommodate complex scripts and enhance the adaptability of smart contracts.

SegWit (Segregated Witness) addresses this by removing the signature from the transaction data, fixing the malleability problem, and enhancing security. DYOR</p><p>—</p><p><strong>SegWit Adoption: Benefits and Challenges in Bitcoin:</strong><br>The adoption of Segregated Witness (SegWit) in the Bitcoin ecosystem has introduced several advantages, such as increased security and reduced fees. However, its implementation has encountered challenges due to the need for network-wide upgrades, adjustments to software and services, and resistance to change. Overcoming these hurdles requires collaboration and patience, but as users recognize the benefits, the push towards broader SegWit adoption gains traction.</p><p>When considering the design of a new product, Segregated Witness (SegWit) stands out as the optimal choice to embrace. One of SegWit’s remarkable features is its compatibility with existing systems, making the transition seamless and efficient.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthewShelby/Melarix/main/assets/Article/004-1/03.webp\"></figure><p><br>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Definitions:</span></h3><p><br><strong>Witness Script:</strong></p><p>The Witness Script is like a set of rules that defines how to spend Bitcoin from a Pay-to-Witness-Pubkey-Hash (P2WSH) address. Most often, this script outlines how a SegWit multi-signature wallet works.</p><p>For a P2WSH address, there’s a special code, the scriptPubKey, that holds the hash of the Witness Script. To unlock the funds in a P2WSH address, the owner must show the Witness Script that matches the hash in the scriptPubKey, along with the needed signatures and public keys specified in the script.</p><p>Think of the Witness Script as the SegWit version of the redeemScript in a P2SH transaction. But here’s the neat part: in P2WSH, the Witness Script is placed in the Witness field, not the main transaction data, making spending P2WSH inputs more cost-effective than P2SH inputs.</p><p>—</p><p><strong>Redeem Script:</strong></p><p>A Redeem Script is like a secret code to unlock Bitcoin stored in a P2SH or P2WSH address. When you send Bitcoin to a P2SH or P2WSH address, it gets locked to the code’s hash. Only someone who knows the code and provides the necessary signatures can access Bitcoin. Redeem scripts are often used for multi-signature setups or SegWit scripts wrapped in P2SH or P2WSH addresses.</p>","about":"","abstract":"","author":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Person","@id":"001","gender":"male","name":"Matthew","url":"https://matthewshelby.github.io/portfolio/","email":"matthewshelb@gmail.com","sameAs":"[https://www.linkedin.com/in/mt-shelby,https://matthewshelby.github.io/portfolio/]","familyName":"Shelby","alternateName":"Mtthew Shelby","jobTitle":"Blockchain Developer","alumniOf":{"@type":"Organization","name":["Melarix","Melarix.com"]},"knowsAbout":["BLockchain","Web3","Crypto Currency"]},"dateModified":"2024-01-06T11:37:42.743Z","datePublished":"2023-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","isPublished":true,"sideAssets":[""],"suggestedArticles":["19"],"difficultyLevel":0,"acceptedPayments":[],"keyTakeaways":[],"__v":0},{"_id":"65994c3a88ba66965ccea4d6","id":"21","number":3,"courseId":"","courseName":"","articleId":"21","articleName":"What are ERC Standards.","title":"What_are_ERC_Standards","description":"The Evolution of ERC Standards - Understanding 20, 721, and 1155 Tokens.","contentType":0,"keywords":["ERC"," Blockchain"," Crypto currency"],"language":"en","category":[0,0,5],"url":"","thumbnailUrl":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthewShelby/Melarix/main/assets/Article/005-2/What-Are-ERC-Standards.png","producer":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Person","@id":"001","gender":"male","name":"Matthew","url":"https://matthewshelby.github.io/portfolio/","email":"matthewshelb@gmail.com","sameAs":"[https://www.linkedin.com/in/mt-shelby,https://matthewshelby.github.io/portfolio/]","familyName":"Shelby","alternateName":"Mtthew Shelby","jobTitle":"Blockchain Developer","alumniOf":{"@type":"Organization","name":["Melarix","Melarix.com"]},"knowsAbout":["BLockchain","Web3","Crypto Currency"]},"provider":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Organization","@id":"002","name":"Melarix","url":"https://www.melarix.com/","logo":"https://www.melarix.com/MelarixLogo.png","sameAs":["https://instagram.com/mela.rix?igshid=MzMyNGUyNmU2YQ==","https://discord.gg/BaMGvB63","https://www.linkedin.com/company/melarix/","https://melarix.medium.com/","https://www.youtube.com/@Melarix-com"],"founder":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Person","@id":"001","gender":"male","name":"Matthew","url":"https://matthewshelby.github.io/portfolio/","email":"matthewshelb@gmail.com","sameAs":"[https://www.linkedin.com/in/mt-shelby,https://matthewshelby.github.io/portfolio/]","familyName":"Shelby","alternateName":"Mtthew Shelby","jobTitle":"Blockchain Developer"}},"createDate":"2024-01-06T12:48:57.911Z","updateDate":"2024-01-06T13:49:06.034Z","code":"005-2","shortTitle":"What are ERC Standards.","longTitle":"The Evolution of ERC Standards - Understanding 20, 721, and 1155 Tokens.","schemaName":"What are ERC Standards.","shortDescription":"The Evolution of ERC Standards - Understanding 20, 721, and 1155 Tokens.","longDescription":"long","schemaDescription":"The Evolution of ERC Standards: Understanding 20, 721, and 1155 Tokens.","technologiesUsed":[""],"timeRequired":"0H10M0S","audience":["Everyone curious about Ethereum standards.
